This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin: using the `first()` function on an empty list.  The code in `bug.kt` shows the problem, and `bugSolution.kt` provides the corrected version using `firstOrNull()`.  `first()` throws a `NoSuchElementException` when the collection is empty, while `firstOrNull()` returns `null`, which can be handled more gracefully. This is crucial for defensive programming and preventing unexpected crashes.
